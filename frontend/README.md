# Project_Netflix_Clone

A Netflix clone application built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), which interacts with the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to fetch movie data. This project is a full-stack web app designed to mimic the features and design of Netflix.

# Project Overview
